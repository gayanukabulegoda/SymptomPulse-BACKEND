## Security Practices

We are committed to ensuring that the SymptomPulse BACKEND is secure and reliable. Key security measures include:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user authentication is enforced using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Bcrypt to safeguard user credentials and sessions.
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive information is managed with strict access controls and encrypted communication channels.
- **Regular Code Reviews**: All code contributions are thoroughly reviewed to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management**: Third-party libraries and dependencies (such as Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma, and MySQL) are regularly audited and updated to address security issues.
- **API Security**: API endpoints are designed following industry best practices, including input validation, rate limiting, and secure error handling.
- **Configuration Management**: Sensitive configuration details (e.g., database credentials, JWT secrets) are managed through secure configuration files and environment variables, ensuring they are not exposed in the repository.

## Handling Security Issues

- **Responsible Disclosure**: We adhere to responsible disclosure practices. Details of any vulnerability will be shared publicly only after a fix has been merged.
